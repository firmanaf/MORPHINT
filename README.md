# MORPHINT
MORPHINT is a QGIS Processing plugin for analyzing urban morphology     and development intensity from building footprints and raster data. It computes parcel-based intensity indicators such as Building Coverage Ratio (BCR), Floor Area Ratio (FAR), and Open Space Ratio (OSR), and derives detailed building morphometrics.
